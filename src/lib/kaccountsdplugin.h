/**
 * Plugin for KAccounts daemon
 *
 * The plugin is loaded into the KAccounts daemon (a module in KDED)
 * and listens for events - new account created, account removed,
 * account service enabled and service disabled, allowing to execute
 * specialized actions with certain accounts and services.
 *
 * Each plugin should be accompanied by a provider file (if one doesn't
 * exist yet, like Google) and a service file describing the details
 * of the service. See AccountsQt docs for details.
 *
 * An example - you have an application that is working with calendars.
 * You write a plugin by extending this class. Then you add a Google
 * account into KAccounts and onAccountCreated in your plugin gets called.
 * Now your plugin must check if it is interested in the account that was added
 * and/or the services that come with it. If yes, you can set up the calendar
 * in your application in this method, using the Google OAuth token from KAccounts.
 * When the Calendar service gets disabled for Google account, your plugin
 * should disable the Google calendar in your application.
