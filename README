# Setting up accounts-sso

Accounts-SSO is the framework we are using to store secrets (tokens, passwords)
and for storing Accounts (small pieces of information containing a name,
a provider, etc).

https://accounts-sso.gitlab.io/

## Accounts

This is a fairly simply yet powerful framework, it stores all information into a
sqlite database and then propagates the modifications using dbus so all applications
using libaccounts will be aware of the modifications.

### libaccounts-glib

The first thing to compile is libaccounts-glib, which is the code implementing
all the Read/Write/Notification of Accounts:

    git clone https://gitlab.com/accounts-sso/libaccounts-glib libaccounts-glib
    cd libaccounts-glib
    meson build
    ninja -C build && ninja -C build install

### libaccounts-qt

This is the Qt bindings for libaccounts-glib, it uses qmake.

    git clone https://gitlab.com/accounts-sso/libaccounts-qt libaccounts-qt
    cd libaccounts-qt
    qmake
    make && make install

Note that at this very day libaccounts-qt qmake does **NOT** support compiling the
library outside the source directory, this means that the command qmake must be
executed within the root of libaccounts-qt and not for example in a build directory.

##SSO

Single Sign On is the part of the framework responsable for storing and obtaining
credentials. It stores the credentials in a secure way (in case of KDE within
KWallet) and has a plugin system to do authentication in most common cases such
oauth/2 or simple user and password.

An interface can be plugged into SSO, at this moment we are using ubuntu's
implementation signon-ui but that will changes in the future.

### signond

This includes a daemon that will be dbus activated and will offer a set of dbus api
to access to credentials and to authenticate to services (google/facebook oauth or
owncloud user/password). Within this same repo there is a Qt library that we'll use
in our applications to talk to the daemon.

    git clone https://gitlab.com/accounts-sso/signond signond
    qmake
    make && make install

Note: Since signond is *dbus* activated be sure that the file
`com.google.code.AccountsSSO.SingleSignOn.service` is in a location where dbus
can find it (usually /usr/share/dbus-1/services)

### Wallet support

In order for sigond to talk to KWallet we need a plugin for it, otherwise it will
store secrets (tokens and passwords) in plain text

    git clone git://anongit.kde.org/signon-kwallet-extension.git
    mkdir signon-kwallet-extension/build
    cd signon-kwallet-extension/build
    cmake ..
    make && make install

### oauth2 plugin

This plugin makes signond able to deal with oauth2 authentication

    git clone https://gitlab.com/accounts-sso/signon-plugin-oauth2 signon-plugin-oauth2
    mkdir signon-plugin-oauth2/build
    cd signon-plugin-oauth2/build
    qmake ..
    make install

### signon-ui

At the moment we are u sing Ubuntu's UI which is under CLA and hosted in Launchpad.
We don't plan to use this for a long time but at the moment it works.

    bzr branch lp:signon-ui
    cd signon-ui
    qmake PREFIX= LIBDIR=
    make install

TODO: migrate to signon-qt from accounts-sso gitlab.

Note that this project does **NOT** support out of tree builds

### kde providers

This are the providers and services that at this very moment we provide support for.
For example in Facebook we support Chat, Contacts Calendar... for what we need a
facebook.provider and chat/contacts/calendar.service files. This is basically a bunch
of icons and .xml files

    git clone git://anongit.kde.org/kaccount-providers.git
    mkdir kaccount-providers/build
    cd kaccount-providers/build
    cmake ..
    make install

##Telepathy support

### Mission Control UOA pluging

If you use ubuntu, you can get it from repositories.
If you use arhclinux, you can fetch it from aur
If you have (or want) to compile it yourself, grab mission-control and apply
uoa.patch
