This document specifies the roadmap towarsd a total rewrite of WebAccounts using the framework
accounts-sso.

Instead of starting a new project, we've decide to modify webaccounts bit a bit until the point where
all the code has been replaced and a new functional KCM/system is born. This way we can keep history and
make sure that we are not missing anything once finished.

Steps:
    1-AccountsModel to replace the KConfig+QListWidget hack
    2-ProvidersModel to replace create/types widget
        -Maybe we will need a service model as well
    3-KDE Signon-ui
    4-KDE auth plugins (oauth2 and password)
    5-Move telepathy code (if needed) into the ktp-kded and monitor account created/removed events
    6-Create or move to a daemon the akonadi code to create or remove the needed resources once an
        account is removed or created.
    7-Create or move to a daemon the code that create dolphin places
    8-Create a signond backend for KWallet
    9-Release 1.0 :)

We'll try to keep this file updated with all the steps we do.
